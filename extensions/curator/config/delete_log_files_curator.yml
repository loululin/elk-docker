      Delete indices. Find which to delete by first limiting the list to
      logstash- prefixed indices. Then further filter those to prevent deletion
      of anything less than the number of days specified by unit_count.
      Ignore the error if the filter does not result in an actionable list of
      indices (ignore_empty_list) and exit cleanly.
